<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="819" delta="old" >&quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">C:/Users/Lenovo/Desktop/proyecto1/regfile.vhd</arg>&quot; line <arg fmt="%d" index="2">29</arg>: One or more signals are missing in the process sensitivity list. To enable synthesis of FPGA/CPLD hardware, XST will assume that all necessary signals are present in the sensitivity list. Please note that the result of the synthesis may differ from the initial design specification. The missing signals are:

<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="647" delta="old" >Input &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">a&lt;31:30&gt;</arg>&gt; is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="738" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - <arg fmt="%d" index="1">1024</arg> flip-flops were inferred for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">mem</arg>&gt;. You may be trying to describe a RAM in a way that is incompatible with block and distributed RAM resources available on Xilinx devices, or with a specific template that is not supported. Please review the Xilinx resources documentation and the XST user manual for coding guidelines. Taking advantage of RAM resources will lead to improved device usage and reduced synthesis time.
